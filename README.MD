# eBot API

This is an API to interact with the popular CS:GO Match Manager [eBot](http://www.esport-tools.net/ebot/). It is still a work in progress, not to be used for production quite yet.

## Install

To get the API, you need to get [Composer](http://getcomposer.org). Once you have Composer installed, run `composer require team-reflex/ebot-api` in your project directory.  This will download the API so you can use it.
